# MATRIX
Well hello, I sought out to write a program to calculate for various functions in a matrix. I have learnt C++ in the first year thus all of my code in this project would be in C++. I decided to write different codes for each function being it ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, INVERSE, MULTIPLICATION or whatever it is. Then I pulled all the functions together to form a whole program which has all these functions together. For each individual function though, I tried to write a sketchy algorithm and a flowchart too. However I was not able to write for all the functions, most predominant is the main build. I tried however to make the code as simple as it gets and yeah it is simple because of the basic training I had thus. Have a nice spin and yeah again, Hello World.
